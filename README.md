# sockdrive to zip
If you have tried downloading games from [dos.zone](https://dos.zone), you may have noticed that any game of large size isn't included with the .jsdos bundle, the bundle only includes a configuration file, which specifies where the [sockdrive](https://github.com/caiiiycuk/sockdrive) should get mounted.

This tool allows you to download any game that is mounted from a [sockdrive](https://github.com/caiiiycuk/sockdrive)

# usage

    `python3 -m http.server`

 - Open a browser and navigate to the url
    `http://localhost:8000`

 - Enter the game's drive ID and press `Start Download`
